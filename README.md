# UDACITY--Investigating-a-Dataset-with-Pandas-and-NumPy
This is done in relation with the UDACITY Data Analyst course and will involve the exploration of the Kaggle TMDb movie dataset.

This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
I will be formulating questions to explore this data set, as well as answering these questions with the help of Pandas and NumPy.
